### Stay Safe, Sacramento

I'm a JavaScript programmer full-stack. The technologies I used: 
- Socket.io for real time chat
- Mongoose (MongoDB) for data storage
- Express for the server
- React for the interface
- Bcrypt for password hashing
- JWT for authorizing requests
- Plain old CSS for styling the React

TODO: 

- [ ] In rooms.js, if the request user is the same as the recipient (meaning a user tried to be sneaky and send a chat to himself), abort. In PeopleList.js, I made it so that the user doesn't show up in the list of users so that they can't click on themselves to chat with themselves.
